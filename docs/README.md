## 🎯 Common Tasks

### 🆕 Container Development

```bash
# VSCode DevContainers (Recommended for developers)
# 1. Install VSCode and Dev Containers extension
# 2. Clone and open in VSCode
git clone https://github.com/LyeosMaouli/lm-archlinux-desktop.git
code lm-archlinux-desktop
# 3. Reopen in Container (Ctrl+Shift+P -> "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")

# Docker Compose development
docker compose up -d dev docs   # Start development environment
docker compose exec dev bash    # Access development container
dev-deploy --dry-run full      # Test deployment with monitoring
```

### Installation

```bash
# Fully automated installation
git clone https://github.com/LyeosMaouli/lm-archlinux-desktop.git && cd lm-archlinux-desktop
./scripts/deploy.sh full
```

### Testing

```bash
# Container testing (recommended)
docker compose --profile testing up test
docker compose exec test ./scripts/testing/test_installation.sh

# VirtualBox testing
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LyeosMaouli/lm-archlinux-desktop/main/scripts/testing/auto_vm_test.sh -o vm_test.sh
chmod +x vm_test.sh
./vm_test.sh
```

### Maintenance

```bash
# System status with performance monitoring
system-status

# System updates
system-update

# Security audit with structured logging
sudo /usr/local/bin/audit-analysis

# 🆕 Development environment maintenance
dev-monitor               # Monitor deployment performance
dev-lint                 # Run code quality checks
dev-security-scan        # Security scan development environment
docker compose down -v   # Clean development volumes
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Network connectivity problems:**

```bash
# Run network recovery
./scripts/utilities/network_auto_setup.sh recovery
```

**SSH key issues:**

```bash
# Keys are automatically generated
# View public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
```

**Ansible deployment failures:**

```bash
# Run with verbose output
ansible-playbook -vvv -i configs/ansible/inventory/localhost.yml local.yml
```

### Log Locations
